Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.
Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. 
In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.
Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards.
